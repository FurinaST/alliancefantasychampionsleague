  <p>The Alliance of Fantasy is a multi-league, multi-sport association that offers fantasy sports for over 64 unique franchises, spread all around the entire globe.</p>
  <p>The AFF, or Alliance of Fantasy Football is the most popular and original sport that the Alliance has hosted, entering their 5th year of the Gridiron and 4th year of being a 16-man league format.  Using the Sleeper app, The AFF has grown from a 10-team, 1 league organization, to a 64-team, 4 league pyramid.</p>
  <p>In tandem with the AFF, the AA, or Alliance Association, also exists to run a domestic cup competition where all 64 teams are allowed to compete for the grand prize of a trophy and cash for their efforts.  These competitions exist as a complimenting co-existance to one another, and aim to create more opportunities for players to be engaged and competing on a week-to-week basis.</p>
  <p>The ABA, or Alliance Basketball Association, is the Fantasy Basketball League that the Alliance offers for players who enjoy the Sleeper format of the game.  The APL, or Alliance Premier League, is the Fantasy Premier League (soccer) that is played on a much smaller scale to the AFF and ABA, with only a few members involved.</p>
